            <h5>Manage Your Vehicles in One Place</h5>
            <p>
                Our application provides a clear and organized way to keep track of all the vehicles in your fleet.
                Users can easily add, edit, or remove individual cars, including key details such as make, model, year,
                and license plate. Each user has access only to their own data – securely and privately.

            <h5>Detailed Records of Repairs and Trips</h5>
            <p>
                For every vehicle, you can maintain a detailed history of repairs and trip logs. The repairs section
                allows you to track maintenance, part replacements, and inspections. Trip records help you monitor routes,
                trip purposes, and mileage. Everything is designed to give you full control and insight into your fleet's
                condition and usage.
